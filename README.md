This is my Bot for the _Bots Coding Night_.

At the coding night 2019 _escape_ worked well, all the other modes not so much, with _horde_ performing worst.
So there is a lot of stuff to improve until the next coding night.

---

Todo for the improved version:
 - Show a (semi-)live map where the bot is going for better debugging
 - Save the map
 - Improve/redo the gamemodes
